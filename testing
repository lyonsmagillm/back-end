  "genre": "Crime, Drama, Thriller",
  "comment": "The story falls flat due to weak writing. While a few scenes are dramatically well-executed, they fail to captivate the audience, making the movie feel tedious from the start. The progression in both writing and direction is lacking, raising the question of whether a sequel was necessary in the first place."
